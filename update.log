<<<<<< NOTES >>>>>>
How this works:
Each  update is initialized with #update {date}.
This helps keep track of what i have done and when.

The structure of these updates goes as stated below.
DONE: {what i have completed in the update}
DO: {what i need to do for next update}
OPTIONAL: {things that would be cool to have but arent necessary.}
LEFTOFF: {where i left off}
